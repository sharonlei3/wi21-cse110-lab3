        <main>
            <p> I'm a fourth year student at the University of California, San Diego studying Mathematics and Economics with a 
                minor in Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p> I am currently working as a student worker at the business office of Scripps Institute of Oceanography ,not to 
                be confused with Scripps Hospital. Before we went remote, I was able to see the ocean waves from my office space 
                which was my favorite part of the day.
