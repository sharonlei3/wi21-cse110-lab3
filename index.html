        <main>
            <p> I'm a fourth year student at the <strong>University of California, San Diego</strong> studying <i>Mathematics and Economics with a 
                minor in Computer Science.</i>
            </p>
            <p> I am currently working as a student worker at the business office of <b>Scripps Institute of Oceanography</b>,not to 
                be confused with Scripps Hospital. Before we went remote, I was able to see the ocean waves from my office space 
                which was my favorite part of the day.

        <p>In the future I want to pursue a career in the field of software development. I enjoy the processing of figuring our what algorithm 
            to implement in order for the program to run smoothly. When I was first exposed to computer science I used to struggle with code 
            as simple as <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/turtle-programming-python/">turtle programming in python:</a>
        </p>
        <p><code>
            t = turtle.Turtle()<br>
            t.right(90)
        </code></p>

            <p>On my free time, I enjoy watching YouTube videos. One of my favorites is Mike Chen
                because he creates content of him traveling around the world and trying out food from various countries.</p>

                <pre>You can adjust the size of the video by toggling with the buttons below.</pre>
